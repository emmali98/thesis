        <p>The hat is designed for fishers. <br>There used to be a lot of this insect <br>called the mosquito,
          that were populous <br>around areas with still water. They <br>would bite people for the protein in
          <br>their blood in order to have offspring.</p>
        <p>The bites would itch. So fishers <br>added a veil to their sunhats. <br>It does a decent job hiding <br>me.</p>

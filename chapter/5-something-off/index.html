    <p class="leg">
      His leg was broken when I found him,
      <br>and an infection had already set in.
    </p>
    <p class="perverse">
      In a perverse way, nursing him back to health felt like
      <br>a revenge against the man who made me. That I
      <br><span class="indent-1">could save something he couldn't. That everything he</span>
      <br><span class="indent-2">built me for was only being used in service of this </span>
      <br>stray cat.
    </p>
    <p class="name">I didn't name him. You did. I didn't
      <br><span class="indent-2"> want to get attached. I am supposed to get</span>
      <br>attached, and I wanted to see if I could
      <br>defy that programming.
    </p>
    <p class="follow">
      But Marvin likes me.<br>He follows me around.
    </p>
    <p class="understand">
      He doesn't understand purpose or design.
      <br>He understands food, comfort, security, kindness.

    </div>
    <p class="scared">I was scared of him when I first found him.</p>
    <p class="expect">
      I hadn't interacted with many living creatures, beyond
      <br>scaring off the people from my bridge. I knew what to
      <br>expect, I'm supposed to know even how everything thinks,
      <br>including stray cats, but I was frightened.
    </p>
    <p class="what-if">What if he did something unexpected?
      <br><span class="indent-3">What if he dies in my care?</span>
      <br>What if he
    </p>

    <p class="wasnt">But he wasn't afraid.</p>

  <div class="clothes">
    <p class="indent-1">
      People had a lot of clothes. Useless things, that would fall apart
      <br>and often did crumble away in my hands.
    </p>
    <p class="indent-2">
      It reminded me of something I read,
      <br>of how textiles mimic the lifespan of human bodies.
    </p>
    <p class="indent-2">
      It felt perverse for me to wear them at first.
      <br>But I realized the power a good disguise had.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="off">
    <p>
      My silhouette in this coat and pants and boots is threatening.
      <br>But familiar. The people on the birdge know the silhouette,
      <br>the man in a coat.
    </p>
    <p>But if the coat is off</p>
    <p class="last">they know something is off.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="roam">
    <p>Marvin likes to roam.</p>
    <p class="trail">
      For the first couple years, I would trail him everywhere
      <br>to make sure he wouldn't be hurt. But I could tell he
      <br><span class="indent-1">was irritated. I gave him space for a few weeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="one-day">And one day I found him with you.</p>
    <p class="lovely">"Lovely Marvin!"</p>
    <div class="eyes">
      <p>
        I felt ashamed for not having named him,
        <br>for a little child beating me to it. I felt
        <br>jealous you chose his name first. I thought
        <br>about all the ways you could hurt him, and
        <br>I watched you two play, tense and wary.
      </p>
      <div class="image" id="wary">
        <img src="static/images/5-something-off/wary.png"/>
      </div>
      <p>
        And I recognized you immediately, of course.
        <br>Your DNA, but also your face. Your expression.
        <br>Your voice saying thank you and now calling
        <br>Marvin's name.
      </p>
      <div class="image" id="calling">
        <img src="static/images/5-something-off/calling.png"/>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="not-like">I know you're not like him.</p>
    <p class="see">
      I see how you treat Marvin. How you check him for fleas,
      <br>how you bring him treats, how you play with him,
      <br>despite not owning him. Despite not needing to help him.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="stop">
    <p>I don't know why I stay in the city, near the bridge.</p>
    <p class="meadow">I know Marvin likes seeing you in the meadow a few miles inland.</p>
    <p class="keep">I have the garden to keep.</p>
    <p class="attention">I pay attention to the bridge,
      <br>so people don't fall,
      <br>and so they don't enter the city,
      <br>and hurt themselves in the ruins.
    </p>
    <p class="leave">
      But I could just leave. I could leave Marvin with you,
      <br>let the garden rot,
      <br>let the bridge and people fall,
    </p>
    <p class="looking">stop reading and watching and looking,</p>
    <p class="coat">stop wearing the coat and hat, </p>
    <p class="everything">stop everything.</p>

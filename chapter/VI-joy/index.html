    <p class="girl ask">Why are you angry?</p>
    <p class="storms">Did you know the storms used to only <br>
    last hours, not weeks?</p>
    <p class="sea">The sea was safe to swim in,<br> without poisoning your skin?</p>
    <p class="cities">
      The cities were full of people and <br>life? Not so full of ghosts and
      <br>ruins and dead people's things?

      And even before these disasters happened, <br>could you understand the stupid luxuries
      <br>people invented for themselves,
    </p>

      <br>the greed? Senselessly cruel, <br>and wrapped up in pretty words.</p>

    <p class="did">Did they try to mitigate the damage? <br>Did they take responsibility?</p>
    <p class="hid">They ran away and hid.</p>
    <p class="when">
      When the air grew hot and choking, <br>they moved north and bought air <br>purifiers.

    <p class="when-2">
      When people fell ill, they sold the <br>cure to other nations at a premium.

      When the seas grew high and dangerous, <br>they sold their beach houses and <br>changed vacation plans.

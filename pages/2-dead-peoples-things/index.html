      <p>After I woke up, there was a period where I was very confused.</p>
      <p>Everything was different from what I had been told things would be.
        <br>I had questions, but I couldnâ€™t ask anyone for an explanation.</p>
      <p>I searched on my own.
        <br>I walked through dead streets and crossed dead land.</p>

      <div class="girl">
        <p>Do you feel human <br>yourself?</p>
        <p>Do you feel alive?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="stuff">
        <p class="block">I went through dead people's things.</p>
        <div class="block">
          <p>The stuff in the deepest, most dilapidated cities <br>felt most familiar.</p>
          <p class="indent">There were things that felt familiar but that I had never <br>
          seen. They must've been made after I had been slept.</p>
          <p class="indent">They didn't work anymore. Whatever I had, hadn't <br>
          been made commercially available. Or maybe <span class="red-light">he</span> had <br>
          just gotten a reall good patent. Like those round pizza boxes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
          <p>I liked the older stuff more, though.</p>
          <p class="half-indent">People never got over paper books, especially people who <br>
          read poetry or classics. It's harder to find sci-fi and <br>fantasy.
          And it isn't helpful for how things actually <br> happened, but I read them anyway.</p>
          <p class="indent">I have time.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="games">
        <p>I played video games. I played a <span class="italic">lot</span> of video games.<br>
        It makes sense that I'm good at them, but I didn't expect <br>
        to feel so compelled to play them as I did.</p>
        <p>I could've spent eternity playing those games, but I started . . . </p>
        <p>having strange visions</p>
        <p>dreams?</p>
        <p>I can't dream but</p>
        <p>something like that</p>
        <p>started happening. I couldn't stop seeing him</p>
        <p>It grew unbearable.</p>
        <p>It was evil.</p>
        <p>I started smelling blood every time I woke up.<br>
        I'm not supposed to need sleep.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I fear that I'll sleep and wake up <br>in another time, and this time there will be no
        <br>people to turn away, no Marvin to feed, no books <br> and possessions to steal.</p>
        <p>But I wake up every morning.</p>
        <p>I stopped playing video games.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="killing-games">
        <p>They made killing fun.<br>They made it mindless for me, in a way I suspected it
          <br>was always supposed to be if there weren't soemthing<br>wrong with me.</p>
        <p>The man who made me loved these games. He might've been
          <br>even better than me. I felt proud to be as good as I was.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="portal-2">
        <p>The last game I played was different. There wasn't much killing,<br>except of half-sentient robots.</p>
        <p>You are a woman who was asleep for a long time, brought out of sleep
          <br>by this sentient robot who controls the vast, dilapidated underground science center
          <br>where you are trapped. You are forced to solve puzzles revolving around
          <br>a gun that cannot kill, but can only create portals. And while your
          <br>purpose is to test and her purpose is to test, you escape and
          <br>in the end, she gives up too.
        </p>
        <p>I was happy for the main character. But I was also happy for
          <br>the robot.

    <div class="row 2">
      <div class="movies">
        <p>Movies could be quite ugly. Not visually, but they made me feel
          <br>like the people in the film, making it, who wanted it to play
          <br>out the way it did, had something ugly inside.
        </p>
        <p>There were violent films. Some felt right.</p>
        <p>But many felt sickening. They reminded me of the
          <br>ruins, the bunkers, how good I am at killing.
          <br>They reminded me of my nightmares.
        </p>
        <p>Even if a film wasn't violent, they were condescending.
          <br>They were lying to me and knew it.
        </p>
        <p>But there were some films that felt right.
          <br>I couldn't tell if I was happy or sad at
          <br>the end of them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="girl">
        <p>Why is it important to you
        <br>to do what you aren't made <br>to do?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="confusion">
        <p>I looked through people's things to solve my confusion,
          <br>but it only made it worse.
        </p>
        <p>How did people ruin things when they made music?
          <br>When they had collections of odd, useless, beautiful things?
          <br>Why did I find them charming when I knew everything
          <br>wrong with them?
        </p>
        <p>the color-coded boxes of yarn, recipe books,
          <br>weights for body-building, newspaper clippings,
          <br>bottlecaps, pornography, nail polish, boy band
          <br>merchandise, pet toys, hunting guns, encyclopedias.
        </p>
        <p>None of it helped me understand. But all of it was
          <br>fascinating. And I hated it for being fascinating.
          <br>I was angry with myself for caring.
        </p>
        <p>I was angry, but I still looked.</p>
        <p>I sang. I found instruments and fixed them.
          <br>I could imitate any singer. People only seem to
          <br>sing about love.
        </p>
        <p>I can sing a song now.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="books">
        <p>There are a lot of books. Most of the physical copies
          <br>have rotted and turned to dust by now, but there is still
          <br>the odd library or private collection in the dryer climes
          <br>where there are still books I haven't read.
        </p>
        <p>Obviously it's faster if I "read" the ebooks. It's
          <br>instantaneous. And technically, even with the
          <br>physical copies, I can flip the pages at 120 pages
          <br>a minute without damaging the paper. But I pretend
          <br>someone is reading the text aloud to me. To slow
          <br>things down.
        </p>
        <p>Philosophy. History. Literary fiction. Harlequin
          <br>romance. Science-fiction. Fantasy. Children's
          <br>picture books. Cookbooks. Self-help.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="disagree">
        <p>I realized there was a lot I didn't know. Or wasn't
          <br>told before being put to sleep in the bunker. Or maybe
          <br>the man who made me disagreed with the authors I read,
          <br>like how they disagreed with each other.
        </p>
        <p>And I was confused, because I realized that I could
          <br>disagree with what I knew. I could change my mind.
          <br>And I'm not supposed to do that.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="cookbooks">
        <p>I don't know why I read the cookbooks. I made a
          <br>garden, which does well, and I cooked the food.
          <br>But I couldn't eat it. I just finished plating it,
          <br>and then gave the meat to Marvin.

        <p>I can't get hungry.</p>
        <p>I don't get tired.</p>
        <p>I don't need to breathe,</p>
        <p>to stay warm,</p>
        <p>to stay cool,</p>
        <p>to worry about my body breaking on me.</p>
        <p>I can't actually see the color orange of the sun through eyelids.
          <br>I'll never be able to see that color.
        </p>
        <p>I know it exists beause it was reduced to a piece of data
          <br>deemed useful for me to know, in order to make me more
          <br>efficient at caretaking.
        </p>
        <p>I don't really understand what suffering was
          <br>to the people Before.
        </p>
        <p>What it was like to go hungry,
          <br>to go without sleep,
          <br>to fear your body breaking,
          <br>while searching desperately for shelter.
        </p>
        <p>To be told to find a purpose to avoid suffering,
          <br>but not being able to keep up with its demands.
        </p>
        <p>All the while other live in luxury,
          <br>indulge in stupid pleasures,
          <br>and make it so your suffering is persisted
          <br>so that they may never feel a crumb of discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>I don't understand it,
          <br>so why did it make me so <span class="red-light">angry</span>?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="sci-fi">
        <p>Reading sci-fi made me feel worse. Everything felt foolish.
          <br>The way the apocalypse is imagined is always silly because
          <br>it did happen. Neither of us knows how, but at least I
          <br>know it's not like these books.
        </p>
        <p>But it was probably foolish too. Maybe it's silly that
          <br>I exist. Because I was made for our apocalypse, and
          <br>now there's nothing to do but read about what people
          <br>used to fear.
        </p>
        <p>I also don't like the robots in sci-fi.
          <br>I don't like how they act.
          <br>Or what is expected from them.
        </p>
        <p>I don't understand those characters.
          <br>I don't.
        </p>
        <p>I don't.</p>
        <p>I don't.</p>
        <p>We met before, didn't we? <br>Near the coast?</p>

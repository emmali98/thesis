      <p class="cats">The man who made me liked cats, but only because they were
        <br>low maintenance, in his words. He didn't like the clinginess or
        <br>upkeep required for dogs. He especially didn't like children.
      </p>
      <p>I think if his cat ever got sick, he wouldn't have noticed.</p>
      <p class="ironic">In a way, it's ironic he made something whose whole
        <br>purpose is to notice illness, discomfort, distress.
        <br>And it was supposed to take care of <span class="italic">him</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="hypocrite">He was a hypocrite. He thought himself a well-groomed, not-so-rugged individualist,
        <br>earning his wealth and using his resources to survive through a time
        <br>that he helped orchestrate. But he made himself a nanny and bodyguard
        <br><span class="indent-out">for his underground palace. He didn't know the first thing about how to care</span>
        <br><span class="indent-in">for himself or others. And because he was so clueless and ignorant,</span>
        <br>he was annoyingly <span class="italic">paranoid</span>.

  <div class="plant-book">
    <p>I found a book on local plant identification.</p>
    <p class="many">
      Many of the plants are gone. Extinct, probably.
      <br><span class="indent-in-2">I study the pictures and wonder if I'm the first </span>
      <br>in a long time to care that this particular plant is
      <br><span class="indent-in">missing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="find">
      And sometimes I do find plants.
      <br>The first few times I left them alone,
      <br><span class="indent-in">afraid my presence would corrupt and kill.</span>
      <br><span class="indent-in-2">But when I'd visit the same spots,</span>
      <br><span class="indent-in">they'd still be there, and growing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="cuttings">I learned to take cuttings, to harvest seeds.</p>
    <p class="little">I have a little garden.</p>

  <div class="garden">
    <p>It's humble. I keep it near the bridge, so Marvin knows where I am when he roams.</p>
    <p>I don't feel too much ownership of the city the bridge leads into.</p>
    <p class="explore">I explore it, I find dead people's things, but it's not mine.</p>
    <div class="land">
      <p>The garden is mine. It's hard to maintain, actually,
        <br><span class="indent-in-2">because the land it's on is dead.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="most">Most of the land in and near the old urban areas is dead. Nothing grows. Animals don't like to go there.
        <br>Marvin stays on the bridge or the forest and meadows across mostly. I can't tell what's quite wrong with the land.
        <br><span class="indent-in-2">It's not any pollutant, any air or soil quality issue, any radiation or energy I can detect.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="haunted">Maybe you'd say it's haunted.</p>
      <p class="grief">A lot of grief is in the ruins of the city.</p>
      <p class="wonder">I wonder if the bridge were safe to cross and people came,
        <br>if they could sense it too.
      </p>

  <div class="specs">
    <p class="know">You want to know my specs?</p>
    <p>I can make fires instantly, hike for miles, go without sleep,
      <br>swim like a fish. I can recognize every plant and fungi
      <br>and their nutritional and medicinal values. I have built-in
      <br>heaters and know how to create shelters in nearly every
      <br>clime.
    </p>
    <p class="history">I know the recorded history of the world. I know how
      <br>the ecology of the old world works, the political context of
      <br>the time I was made, how things were made and born
      <br>and died.
    </p>
    <p class="body">But I also have 254 different knives and 72 various
      <br>projectile weapons built into my body. I have a lazer.
      <br>I have perfect hearing and vision, and am outfitted with
      <br>something that can make me smell. I'm strong enough
      <br>to knock over my bridge with a single blow. I could
      <br>run from this meadow to the forested coast where we met
      <br>within a single afternoon, something that would take you
      <br>weeks on foot.
    </p>
    <p class="sense">And I can look at you and tell if you're afraid.
      <br>If you're hungry, happy, tired, cold. I know your
      <br>age, what allergies you have, your blood type.
      <br>I know what it looks like when sunlight
      <br>refracts through the skin of your eyelids. I'll never
      <br>see the orange, but it's been downloaded into me,
      <br>the knowledge that the orange exists.
    </p>
    <p class="kind">I'm a caretaker and protector, but I'm also a companion. I'm supposed to
      <br>understand you. To be kind. To be on your side.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="made">
    <p>That's what I was made to do.</p>
    <p class="like">Like the bunker was made to withstand nuclear war,
      <br>earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, attacks from other people.
    </p>
    <p class="like">Like the pod and its software were made to suspend a person
      <br>in immortal sleep for 30 years at a time, so one could wake
      <br>up and check if the world fixed itself yet.
    </p>
    <p>Except the bunker crumbled from time.</p>
    <p>And the pod didn't wake him up until much, much,</p>
    <p class="much">much, much longer</p>
    <p class="years">than 30 years.</p>
    <p class="red">And I <span class="secret">killed him as soon as he awoke. I killed him. I killed him.</span></p>

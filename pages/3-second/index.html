    <p>You were the second human I'd seen up close since I woke up. No, third.
      <br>And it was my first time seeing a child.

      <p class="entire">The entire hike back to your home, you shivered even though my heating systems
        <br>were on. I suppose you were scared. You saw my face.
      </p>
      <p class="struggle">You didn't struggle, even though I said nothing to you about taking you back to
        <br>your family.
      </p>
      <p class="but">But I remember you saying thank you when we got to the edge of the camp.
        <br>Your voice . . . hearing it was painful. I thought I could go the rest of
        <br>eternity without hearing another voice, but your thank you reminded me that
        <br>I was lying to myself.

    <p class="why">Why I kept reading all these books and watching those movies,
      <br>going through dead people's things and standing on that bridge.
    </p>
    <p>I tried staying away to prove that I could even do it, but I was made for this, wasn't I?
      <br>To "protect and serve"? To love humanity to the point of murder? I probably would've
      <br>killed for you on that walk back to your home. Does that seem right?
